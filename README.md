***‚úàÔ∏è British Airways ‚Äì Data Science Virtual Internship (via Forage)***

I completed a self-paced virtual internship offered by **British Airways** in collaboration with **Forage**, focused on solving real-world data science problems in the aviation industry.

**üîç Overview**

This virtual internship simulated the work of a data analyst/scientist at British Airways, offering hands-on tasks such as:

**Task 1**

Applying webscraping in unstructured data taken from the https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways

‚Ä¢ Preprocessed text data with cleaning, tokenization, POS tagging, stopword removal, and stemming for enhanced
analysis accuracy.

‚Ä¢ Performed Sentiment Analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) to classify
reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments with emotional intensity scores.

**Task 2**

‚Ä¢ Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Engineered features and visualized key trends using pandas,
seaborn,and matplotlib to support data-driven modeling.

‚Ä¢ Built and compared two machine learning models using Random Forest Classifier:

Model 1: Trained using top 6 features selected based on importance scores.

Model 2: Trained using all available features to assess performance differences
